# Knn-Algorithm-on-Different-Datasets
Program of K-nearest Neighbour Classification (on Different Datasets)
I programmed this in ubuntu. So if you want to use this program, linux based System is preferred.
Although it might work on Windows, (I haven't tried it).
You can see better Accuracy in Iris Dataset but the program in Letter Recognition is the better one.
You can apply it to different datasets by changing few parameters.
